# World_Weather_Analysis
UCD Module 6
In this module, we learn how to retrieve data on weather using an application programming interface (i.e., an API).  For the module challenge, we obtain an API key used for Google Cloud Platform in order to use Google Maps.  We learn that we can locate and append specific data (from the retrieved JSON format) into dataframes.  Examples of this are a specific location's city name, or the country, temperature and more.
